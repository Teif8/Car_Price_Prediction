# Car_Price_Prediction
This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars using machine learning models. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development to create an accurate price prediction model.

## Overview
The Used Car Price Prediction project leverages historical data to predict car prices based on various features such as car model, mileage, year of manufacture, and engine size. This project focuses on understanding the relationships between these features and using them to build predictive models.

## Dataset
The dataset contains car-related attributes including:

- Car Model
- Year of Manufacture
- Mileage
- Fuel Type
- Engine Size
- Transmission
- Car Brand, etc.

  ## Modeling Approach
- Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.

Encode categorical features.
 
Normalize or standardize numerical data.

- Modeling:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Decision Trees

Compare models based on metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

- Evaluation:

Models are evaluated using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques.
